# Age-of-war-unity-clone-
Age of war clone made in unity in order to speed up the neat algorithm training process. It sends data via websockets and receives corresponding actions from a python script
This will be a minimalistic and as hardware light as possible. If you want to add things like animations to it, you can take the sprites and look through the codebase in the archieve containing [Age of war](https://github.com/erupturatis/Decompiled-flash-games-archive)
